Home monitoring: Python based home monitoring system which monitors electricity usage and emails warnings if >5kw for over a period (great for monitoring kids showers to make sure they dont stay in there for 45mins!) and room temperatures throughout the house. 

Uses (at the moment) LLAP protocol to talk to temp sensors, these wireless sensors are now obsolete so will be moving to zigbee.
