* TODO sql DB                                                   :improvement:
  set up an sql DB for logging of values consider mariaDB or sqlite3
* TODO home page                                                :improvement:
  - improvements on layout need
  - text on gauges is small
  - no need for reboot/reload buttons
    now that its moved to a flask service based on the actual pi listening to data ports instead of a dual flask system dont need the reboot/refresh buttons
* change display                                                     :option:
  - consider larger display perhaps similar to magic mirror, as this would allow calendar/weather data as well existing gauges
