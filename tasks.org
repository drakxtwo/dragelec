  currentcost unit had lost its connection was displaying zeros, and the python program had hung and then was very very slow to update why? thought about this at 0300 this morn... its because i use the data in from the cuurentcost to drive the rest of the program. eg

  if serial.usb <> 0 then rest of program.

  might be worth a what if serial.usb is dead condition.
